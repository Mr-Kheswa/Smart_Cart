# Smart_Cart
A very small content based Artificial Intelligency application recommender named Smart Cart, it is a minimal content based product recommender. It models each product with two features which are **tags** which will be based on set of keywords and **description** based on short texts. Recommendations combine Jaccard similarity on tags with cosine similarity on **Term frequency - inverse document frequency** [TF-IDF] descriptions & combined score ranks recommendations.
